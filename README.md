  # Virtual Sales Manager                                                       
                                                                                
  A button that gives you random sales manager advice like "Have you updated    
  Salesforce yet?" and "Bring your 'A' game."                                   
                                                                                
  This was my first attempt at building something with pure LLM coding when     
  ChatGPT first came out. Keeping it here as a time capsule.
